Open plan offices are the devil. Everybody is essentially forced to isolate themselves with headphones to avoid any noise, and god help you if the office has the communal music player, satans jukebox, that always ends up playing the most mundane shitty pop music. Why do we work like this? it's not fostering collaboration, creativity or focus. It's distracting, distancing and disturbing.
